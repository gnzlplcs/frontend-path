# Scrimba's Fronted Path

This is another attempt to get and organize notes & code about Fronted concepts and best practices. This is an ambicious project to me, because, literally, I was around to throw away all my efforts to become a frontend developer. This is not the place to talk about these concerns, so, just to be clear, this repo is expected to be a place to consult and complete notes and assignments from the Scrimba's Frontend Path.
